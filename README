This is a git repository of the queue.cppget.org package repository. That is,
every addition, removal, or transition of a package in queue.cppget.org is
tracked in this git repository. Note, however, that old history may be trimmed
from time to time.

The queue recreates a subset of the public repository sections in order to
mirror the availability of the prerequisite packages. In other words, we don't
want a queued stable package to resolve its dependencies from the queued alpha
package. The section structure is as follows, vertical arrows are complements
while horizontal -- prerequisites.

queue        public
-----        ------

alpha   ===> alpha
 ||

beta    ===> beta

testing ===> testing
